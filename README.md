# 📄 Before It's Too Late: A State Space Model for the Early Prediction of Misinformation and Disinformation Engagement
## 📝 Introduction

In today’s digital age, **misinformation and disinformation** can rapidly spread, impacting social and democratic cohesion. While deep learning models have made strides in **engagement prediction**, they struggle with **irregularly sampled data** and **early trajectory forecasting**.

We introduce **IC-Mamba**, a novel **state space model** that forecasts **social media engagement** by integrating **interval-censored data with temporal embeddings**. Our model is particularly effective in predicting engagement patterns within the crucial **first 15-30 minutes of posting** (RMSE 0.118-0.143), offering early insights into content virality.

### 🔹 Key Contributions:
- A **state space framework** for modeling engagement with **interval-censored** data.
- A **4.72% improvement** over state-of-the-art engagement prediction models.
- **Long-term engagement forecasting**: up to **28 days ahead** based on 3-10 days of observations.
- Enables **earlier identification** of potentially problematic content for proactive countermeasures.
